# Petal Boilerplate

A clean install of the latest Phoenix with some extras to get you started:
- Tailwind CSS - using the [mix library](https://hexdocs.pm/tailwind/Tailwind.html)
- Alpine JS - using a CDN to avoid needing `node_modules`
- 🌺 [Petal Components Library](https://github.com/petalframework/petal_components)

## Get up and running

Optionally change your database name in `dev.exs`.

1. Setup the project with `mix setup`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
3. Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Renaming your project

Your app module is currently called `PetalBoilerplate`. There is a script file included that will rename your project to anything you like in one go.
Open the file `rename_phoenix_project.sh` and read the instructions at the top.
